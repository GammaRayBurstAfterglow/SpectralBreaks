This project has three main goals. 

The first is to use a model for gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow emissions
to generate a training data set for a neural network when a particular parameter 𝑘 = 0. 
The second goal is to compare the model to predictions in the literature when that parameter 𝑘 = 2. 
Assuming the model passes, the third goal is a repetition of the first, just with a different value for 𝑘
