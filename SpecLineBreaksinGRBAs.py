k = 0, 2
# radial dependence of the ambient medium
# density is proportional to r^(-k)
# k = 0, constant density, k = 2, 1/r^2

b = 
beta_1 =
beta_2 = 


p = 2.5
# represents the spectral index of the electron distribution
# number of electrons with energy E is proportional to E^(-p)
# range between 2 - 4, 2.5 preferred value.

z = 1 
# cosmological red shift


epsilon_e = 
# fraction of the total energy density in electrons
# between 10^-6 and 0.4

epsilon_e_bar = (epsilon_e*(p-2)) / (p-1)


epsilon_B = 
# fraction total energy density in the magnetic field 
# between 10^-9 and 0.3

epsilon_p = 1 - (epsilon_e + epsilon_B)


n_0 = 
# ambient density in units of particles/cm^3
# height of the density function for k = 0
# between 10^-4 to 10^3

E_52 = 
# explosion energy of the GRB in units of 10^52 ergs
# between 10^-4 and 10^2

A_star = 
# height of the density function for k = 2

t_day = 
# time since explosion in units of days in the observer frame(?)
# 0.01 and 100

d_L28 = 
# luminosity distance in units of 10^28 cm
